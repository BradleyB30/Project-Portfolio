          <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
          <p>
            I am a Computer Science student at Cal State Fullerton, set to graduate in 2027. My academic journey has allowed me to gain experience in C++, Python for machine learning, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript through various projects and collaborations. In C++, I have developed applications such as an Expense Tracker and a Bank Management System, honing my skills in software development. My machine learning endeavors include creating a Breast Cancer Prediction Model and a Mushroom Classification Model, where I applied my knowledge to real-world data challenges. Additionally, as a member of the ACM club’s open source software team, I have enhanced my expertise in web technologies by working on collaborative projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>

                      <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
                      <p>In my machine learning projects, I rely heavily on Python for its vast array of libraries and ease of use. TensorFlow and PyTorch are my go-tos for building and training models, while pandas and numpy help me preprocess data. For visualizing results, I turn to matplotlib and seaborn, creating detailed graphs and charts. Scikit-learn is essential for implementing standard algorithms and evaluating model performance, making it a crucial part of my workflow.</p>

                       <h4>C++</h4>
                       <p>In my C++ projects, I've explored various applications and developed multiple systems. One of my notable projects is a bank management system, which involved creating functionalities for managing accounts, transactions, and user data efficiently. Another exciting project I worked on is a PingPong game, where I used the raylib library to handle graphics and game mechanics. These projects allowed me to deepen my understanding of C++ programming and gain practical experience in both system development and game design. Through these endeavors, I've honed my skills and built a solid foundation in C++.</p>

                    <h4>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</h4>
                    <p>In my web development projects, I’ve crafted various websites and applications using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. A prime example is this very portfolio, where I designed a responsive and visually engaging site to showcase my work. My experience also extends to being part of the ACM club’s open source software team, where we collaborated on projects using these technologies to build and maintain web applications. Working in a team environment allowed me to refine my skills in creating interactive user interfaces and implementing dynamic features. These experiences have been instrumental in shaping my approach to both individual and collaborative web development tasks.</p>
